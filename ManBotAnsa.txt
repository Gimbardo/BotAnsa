python BotAnsa.py    -> to run the bot in his "normal" behaviour: he writes in
                        news.txt the first 5 news on ansa.it

python BotAnsa.py 'filter' 'n_news' 'file'    -> every argument isn't mandatory, but they need to be in order
                                                 (to change 'file', you need to write the other arguments)
                                                 
                                                 filter -> BotAnsa will select only news that contains this filter (default '')
                                                 n_news -> BotAnsa will search only through this number of news (default 5)
                                                 file -> BotAnsa will save articles in a file called this way(default 'news.txt')

BotAnsa.py -> line 10: change this depending on where you place your chromedriver
